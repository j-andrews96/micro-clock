# micro-clock
### *A simple real-time clock/alarm clock for the PIC18F8722*.

This is an optional mini-project, carried out as part of a second year microcontroller engineering module. The aim was to produce a fully-functioning real-time clock/alarm clock based upon the hardware provided by the department, with additional features and functionality as optional extras.

**This code is presented here as-is.** Please feel free to look through, re-use or take inspiration from any aspects of it.

### Building & Running
This project can be opened with Microchip MPLAB X and can be compiled with XC8 v1.34 however more recent versions should also work fine. It makes use of the MPLAB C18 C Compiler Libraries - these are legacy libraries so if you have problems building, make sure these are installed correctly and the linker is configured to use them at build time.

A pre-built .hex file which can be programmed directly to the PIC can be found in the \dist\default\production\ folder.
